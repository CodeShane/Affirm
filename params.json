{"name":"Affirm","tagline":"Affirm for Android","body":"Affirm\r\n======\r\n\r\nAffirm is an Android application that intermittently reminds you of your self-affirmations, goals, resolutions, or whatever else you choose to add.\r\n\r\nThese affirmations, when enabled, work from the background so the device can continue normal use.\r\n\r\n## Technical Overview\r\n\r\nAffirmations are triggered by a scheduled Intent to a BroadcastReceiver; this minimizes resource use by only loading what is necessary to show the message, and then closing. Unless the user is editing the preferences, there are no Activities or Services running.\r\n\r\nAffirm provides a lot of end-user options with minimal overhead by delivering messages via Toast with customized duration, font color, positioning, and more in the works.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n*Contributors and supporters are welcome. I will gratefully accept translations, suggestions, and pull requests.*\r\n\r\n- Shane Ian Robinson (@CodeShane) Developer\r\n\r\n<a class=\"donateLink\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=shane@codeshane.com&item_name=Donation+for+Affirm\">Supporters can give via PayPal™.</a>\r\n###Fine Print###\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2010-2012, Shane Ian Robinson.
